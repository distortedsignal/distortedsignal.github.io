        <h2>An Old Faith, A New Friend</h2>
        <p>I thought it would be interesting to see what happens with someone put questions from various catechisms through <a href="https://chat.openai.com">ChatGPT</a>.</p>
        <p>I don't think this says anything interesting about God, or about the world around us. I think this says something interesting about culture, and how modern culture views faith and God.</p>
        <h3>Technical Considerations</h3>
        <p>In my experience, ChatGPT likes to answer questions with several paragraphs of text. Most catechism questions are meant to be answered tersely. Because of this, I modified the catechism questions to have the following formats:</p>
        <p class="code-text">In a sentence or two, {catechism question}</p>
        <span>In the above example, the </span><span class="code-text">{catechism question}</span><span> was replaced by the appropriate value for the appropriate question.</span>
        <h3>Society Considerations</h3>
        <p>Please don't be rude with this information. Don't email OpenAI. They're dealing with enough stuff right now.</p>
        <p>Please don't recreate this. Part of the reason that I made this was to see what ChatGPT said when asked these questions. If you really need to see these answers yourself, go for it, but I would prefer not to overload OpenAI's servers.</p>
        <p>Please don't take this too seriously. I sent an input to <a href="https://xkcd.com/1838/">some linear algebra</a> that OpenAI was gracious enough to provide me and then I wrote some HTML by hand. This is spur-of-the-moment project, and does not deserve respect.</p>
        <h3>Catechisms</h3>
        <p><a href="westminster-shorter-catechism/index.html">Westminster Shorter Catechism</a></p>
        <p>Please note that some questions have been changed from the original phrasing due to language drift (and what I perceive to be intellectual haughtiness on the part of the original author).</p>
