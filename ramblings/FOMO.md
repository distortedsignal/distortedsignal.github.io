# FOMO, FOBO, FOLO, and Other Fears

Recently, Pastor Fred Mok [gave a sermon](https://www.gardencity.life/sermons?sapurl=Lys2OGQ2L3Nlcm1vbnMvbWkvK2RwdmRwajU/YnJhbmRpbmc9dHJ1ZSZlbWJlZD10cnVlJnJlY2VudFJvdXRlPWFwcC53ZWItYXBwLmxpYnJhcnkubGlzdCZyZWNlbnRSb3V0ZVNsdWc9JTJCZzRxbmRkag==) where he attempts to distinguish between two feelings that seem to be common in the modern world - the Fear Of Missing Out, or FOMO, and the Fear Of a Better Option, or FOBO. While I think he made a valiant attempt, and while I think he raises some good points, I don't believe that this is the most helpful distinction to raise. I think, instead, that it may be more helpful to distinguish between _types_ of FOMO, with the Fear Of a Better Option being one of the types.

## FOBO - or, FOMO, Less One Step

Pastor Mok seems to define FOBO as a feeling where a person will think - at any given time - that there is a better option than being present to the reality around them. The examples he uses - not being present in a conversation with a loved one, browsing Netflix and not committing to an experience, the desire to find an "optimal" family situaion - seem, to me, to be a distinction without a difference. While I understand that these may seem like critical distinctions to some people, I don't believe that they represent significantly different thought patterns from standard FOMO. In fact, it seems to me that each of the given examples, taken to its logical extreme, will _exclusivly result_ in the teller realizing that they want to avoid _missing out_ on some other, better experience. In effect, they have a Fear that they will Miss Out on some better reality.

Taking the pastor's examples, what are we seeking when checking a phone when in the context of another conversation? From a 2013 study[^1], this is the origin of the idea of FOMO. FOMO was initially defined as "a pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent" - exactly what the subject of the story is attempting to avoid! In conversation with a loved one, we are distracted when we think that others may be trying to involve us in something and we would be unkind to them _and to ourselves_ if we shirked that opportunity.

Next, we find our hapless subject browsing through their streaming service of choice - here, Netflix. However, they cannot decide on an experience that they would like to have. How truly unfortunate, that they are unable to decide, because they worry that the next scroll will bring the object of their heart's true desire to the fore! Or perhaps the next scroll! Or the scroll after that! On and on until what little free time they had has vanished, and they are called away to perform other duties. A truly unfortunate case, and all because they didn't want to _miss out_ on a better option.

Interestingly, [studies have been done on Netflix' UI](https://medium.com/@nihalll/case-study-solving-netflixs-binge-scrolling-problem-5bb795d062f) and found that FOMO is a major contributor of why people don't choose shows (check point #4). I'm curious why this study was left out of the reviewed literature.

Finally, we come to someone who wants to find their optimal family situation. This strikes close to home for those in the dating pool, and I'm sure the pastor has talked to many people who have been stung while dating in his career. And, absolutely, in dating, there is a sense of seeing if the person that you're dating is a good fit. And there's also a sense of wanting someone who is everything we could ask for, and, as the old song goes, a little bit more. And so we evaluate if there is a better option than this person, because otherwise, we might _miss out_ on fulfilling relationships.

## Distinction, With Purpose

While I feel that it's been demonstrated that - as presented - FOBO and FOMO are not meaningfully different, I do feel that there is a distinction to be made. I believe the FOMO - or the Fear Of Missing Out - can be decomposed into two distince feelings: The Fear Of a Better Option, or the Fear Of Losing Opportunity. I believe that these are sufficiently different for them to
