# FOMO, FOBO, FOLO, and Other Fears

Recently, Pastor Fred Mok gave a sermon[^1] where he attempts to distinguish between two feelings that seem to be common in the modern world - the Fear Of Missing Out, or FOMO, and the Fear Of a Better Option, or FOBO. While I think he made a valiant attempt, and while I think he raises some good points, I don't believe that this is the most helpful distinction to raise. I think, instead, that it may be more helpful to distinguish between _types_ of FOMO, with the Fear Of a Better Option being one of the types.

## FOBO - or, FOMO, Less One Step

Pastor Mok seems to define FOBO as a feeling where a person will think - at any given time - that there is a better option than being present to the reality around them. The examples he uses - not being present in a conversation with a loved one, browsing Netflix and not committing to an experience, the desire to find an "optimal" family situation - seem, to me, to be a distinction without a difference. While I understand that these may seem like critical distinctions to some people, I don't believe that they represent significantly different thought patterns from standard FOMO. In fact, it seems to me that each of the given examples, taken to its logical extreme, will _exclusively result_ in the teller realizing that they want to avoid _missing out_ on some other, better experience. In effect, they have a Fear that they will Miss Out on some better reality.

Taking the pastor's examples, what are we seeking when checking a phone when in the context of another conversation? From a 2013 study[^2], this is the origin of the idea of FOMO. FOMO was initially defined as "a pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent" - exactly what the subject of the story is attempting to avoid! In conversation with a loved one, we are distracted when we think that others may be trying to involve us in something and we would be unkind to them _and to ourselves_ if we shirked that opportunity.

Next, we find our hapless subject browsing through their streaming service of choice - here, Netflix. However, they cannot decide on an experience that they would like to have. How truly unfortunate, that they are unable to decide, because they worry that the next scroll will bring the object of their heart's true desire to the fore! Or perhaps the next scroll! Or the scroll after that! On and on until what little free time they had has vanished, and they are called away to perform other duties. A truly unfortunate case, and all because they didn't want to _miss out_ on a better option.

Finally, we come to someone who wants to find their optimal family situation. This strikes close to home for those in the dating pool, and I'm sure the pastor has talked to many people who have been stung while dating in his career. And, absolutely, in dating, there is a sense of seeing if the person that you're dating is a good fit. And there's also a sense of wanting someone who is everything we could ask for, and, as the old song goes, a little bit more. And so we evaluate if there is a better option than this person, because otherwise, we might _miss out_ on fulfilling relationships.

## Distinction, With Purpose

While I feel that it's been demonstrated that - as presented - FOBO and FOMO are not meaningfully different, I do feel that there is a distinction to be made. I believe the FOMO - or the Fear Of Missing Out - can be decomposed into two distinct feelings: The Fear Of a Better Option, or the Fear Of Losing Opportunity. I believe that these are sufficiently different for them to have their own separate categories, and I believe that they can be distinguished by the feelings that they engender.

### FOBO and Paralyzing Fears

I feel that the best way to view FOBO is in the context of its outcome. Take the Netflix example from above. Could you watch a show that you're currently considering? Yes. However, you may enjoy another show more. And therefore, you scroll, scroll, scroll. This type of FOMO can be described as wanting a _Better Option_ than the options presented to the user. I would describe this as a _paralyzing_, or _deactivating_, fear. However, if there is such a thing as a _deactivating_ fear, could there be such thing as an _activating_ fear?

### FOLO and Stimulating Fears

Here, the Fear of Losing Opportunity, or FOLO, could be described as the opposite of FOBO. Where someone experiencing FOBO would desire to not commit to any specific option, someone experiencing FOLO would _overcommit_ to an option, potentially detrimentally to themselves or to those around them. I would describe the person checking their phone during a conversation with a loved one as a person in the grip of FOLO - they're worried that they may _lose_ the _opportunity_ to be present to a different reality than the conversation they're presently in. I would argue that this captures the original meaning of the term FOMO as described in 2013[^2], but we must acknowledge that language is fluid and that terms change. It may be helpful to have a decomposition of what the term FOMO means as well as having an umbrella term.

### The FOBO/FOLO Distinction

I think that it is far easier to distinguish between FOBO and FOLO than between the previously provided FOBO and FOMO. All that one must do is observe what type of response this fear provokes a person to do. If the subject of the fear is provoked to _relative inaction_, we could say they are suffering from FOBO. If the subject is provoked to _relative action_, we could say that they are suffering from FOLO.

Examining the earlier examples, we can see that checking a phone while in a conversation would be an example of _FOLO_: the person checking their phone is _taking an action_ that they were not previously taking and that the situation did not call for. While scrolling Netflix is inherently more active than watching Netflix, the act that could be taken is _choosing_. Because the user in this example is _not choosing_, thereby _being inactive_, we can diagnose this user as desiring _better options_ and suffering from _FOBO_.

I think the dating example is the most interesting example provided above. If someone does not want to commit to a dating relationship, it could be because they are worried that a better option may come along. This would be someone whose dating experience is negatively impacted by _FOBO_. There could also be a person who commits to a relationship very quickly, neglecting to get to know their partner, because they believe that this person is the best opportunity they will have at relational happiness. This person can be said to be suffering from _FOLO_. I think this demonstrates the dichotomy between the two quite cleanly - if an action is provoked, the person is probably concerned about _Losing an Opportunity_, whereas if action is _prevented_, the person probably desires _Better Options_.
